This is a reading list for students, practitioners, and researchers
interested in the general area of programmable data plane devices. Topics
include SmartNICs, programmable middleboxes and software/hardware switches,
that is, everything that may underlie a software-defined network, with only
a marginal attention to the major application areas like Network Function
Virtualization, service chaining, or 5G.

in <i>IEEE HPSR</i>, 2018.
</p>

<p>
The reading list is organized into a rough hierarchy based on the major
topics of <i>Abstractions</i>, <i>Architecture</i>, <i>Applications</i>, and
<i>Miscellanea</i>; note that this hierarchy is more or less arbitrary and the
purpose is just to have <i>some</i> organization at all. The individual papers
are tagged as "mustread", "important", and "interesting" (available only in
the HTML version), with the approximate meaning "read at least these papers
to get a good understanding of the area", "papers for getting more familiar
with some sub-areas", and "interesting contributions to the field",
respectively. Just like the hierarchy, the tags are also pretty much
arbitrary and follow the subjective view of the authors; as always, your
mileage may vary.
</p>

<p>
<i>Note:</i> Some of the linked papers are behind paywalls. We double-checked
that all listed papers can be accessed freely by a moderate amount of
googling; we still provide the paywall links as user-provided PDFs often do
not prove overly stable over time.

THe OpenFlow whitepaper. The original idea in OpenFlow was to provide a way
for researchers to run experimental protocols in the networks they use
every day. OpenFlow is based on an Ethernet switch, with an internal
flow-table, and a standardized interface to add and remove flow entries.
This allowed, in addition to allowing researchers to evaluate their ideas
in real-world traffic settings, for OpenFlow to serve as a useful campus
component in large-scale testbeds.

This paper describes a model which combines a parallel model and
heterogeneous multiprocessor implementations.  The parallel packet
processing model uses coarse-grain, SPMD parallelism to free users from
thread management and it requires the host system to locate protocol
headers in the packet before a parallel copy of the program executes.  The
packetC language abstracts and encapsulates familiar packet processing data
sets and operations into new aggregate data types and operators, e.g., for
packets, databases and searchsets.

As an alternative to P4, Protocol-Oblivious Forwarding (POF) is presented
as a key enabler for highly flexible and programmable SDN. The goal is to
remove any dependency on protocol-specific configurations on the forwarding
elements and, in addition to P4's stateless design, enhance the data-path
with new stateful instructions to support genuine software defined
networking behavior. A generic flow instruction set (FIS) is defined to
fulfill this purpose and both hardware-based and open source software-based
prototypes are shown to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of POF.

This seminal paper introduces P4, a high-level language for programming
protocol-independent packet processors. P4 has three goals: (1)
reconfigurability, in that programmers can change the way switches process
packets once they are deployed, (2) protocol independence, in that switches
are not tied to any specific network protocols, and (3) target
independence, in that programmers can describe packet-processing
functionality independently of the specifics of the underlying
hardware. The paper demonstrates P4 by showing configure a switch to add a
new hierarchical label.

The paper presents a case study that uses P4 to express the forwarding behavior 
of a datacenter switch's data plane. In the process, it identifies issues and
strenghts of P4. Some of the lessons learned had, and are having, an impact on
the language evolution. For instance, and most notably, the 
language-architecture separation that has been implemented in newer verions of 
P4.

The paper introduces NetASM, an intermediate representation for
programmable data planes. NetASM is a device-independent language that is
expressive enough to act as the target language for compilers for
high-level languages, yet low-level enough to be efficiently assembled on
various device architectures. It enables conventional compiler optimization
techniques to significantly improve the performance and resource
utilization of custom packet-processing pipelines on a variety of targets.

The paper proposes an API for programming the generation of packets in
programmable switches, instead of forging network packets on the controller
side.  The InSP API allows a programmer to define in-switch packet
generation operations, which include the specification of triggering
conditions, packet's content and forwarding actions.

PVPP is a data-plane program compiler from P4, a data plane DSL based on
match-action tables, to the fd.io Vector Packet Processor (VPP) software
switch, based on the packet processing node graph model. PVPP compiles a

This paper is motivated by the observation that OpenFlow, in its original
design, imposes great overheads, involving the switch’s control-plane too
often.  In order to meet the needs of high-performance networks, the
authors propose and evaluate DevoFlow, which provides less fine-grained
visibility, at significantly lower costs. In a case study, the authors show
that DevoFlow can load-balance data center traffic as well as fine-grained
solutions, but with much fewer flow table entries and using much fewer
control messages.

The paper introduces Pyretic, a novel programming language for writing
composable SDN applications using a set of high level topology and
packet-processing abstractions. Pyretic improves on Frenetic (an earlier
incarnation of a similar language) by adding support for sequential
composition, the use of topology abstractions to define what each module
can see and do with the network, and an abstract packet model that
introduces virtual fields into packets. Modular applications are written
using the static policy language NetCore, which provides primitive actions,
matching predicates, query policies, and policies.

The paper presents Maple, a system that simplifies SDN programming by (1)
allowing a programmer to use a standard programming language to design an
arbitrary, centralized algorithm, to decide the behavior of an entire
network, and (2) providing an abstraction that the programmer-defined,
centralized policy runs on every packet entering a network, and hence is
oblivious to the challenge of translating a high-level policy into sets of
rules on distributed individual switches. To implement algorithmic policies
efficiently, Maple includes not only a highly-efficient multicore
scheduler, but more importantly a novel tracing runtime optimizer that can
automatically record reusable policy decisions, offload work to switches
when possible, and keep switch flow tables up-to-date by dynamically
tracing the dependency of policy decisions on packet contents as well as
the environment.

The paper tackles the challenge to devise a stateful data plane programming
abstraction (versus the stateless OpenFlow match/action table abstraction)
which still entails high performance and remains consistent with vendors'
preference for closed platforms. The authors posit that a promising answer
revolves around the usage of extended finite state machines, as an
extension (super-set) of the OpenFlow match/action abstraction, turn the
proposed abstraction into an actual table-based API, and we show how it can
be supported by (mostly) reusing core primitives already implemented in
OpenFlow devices.

This paper shows how to program data-plane algorithms in a high-level
language and compile those programs into low-level microcode that can run
on programmable line-rate switching chips. The key challenge is that many
data-plane algorithms create and modify algorithmic state. To achieve
line-rate programmability for stateful algorithms, the paper introduces the
notion of a packet transaction: a sequential packet-processing code block
that is atomic and isolated from other such code blocks. The idea is
developed in Domino, a C-like imperative language to express data-plane
algorithms, and many examples are shown that can be run at line rate with
modest estimated chip-area overhead.

Similarly to the "Universal Packet Scheduling" paper, this paper presents
another design for a programmable packet scheduler, which allows scheduling
algorithms, potentially algorithms that are unknown today, to be programmed
into a switch without requiring hardware redesign.  The design uses the
property that scheduling algorithms make two decisions, in what order to
schedule packets and when to schedule them, and exploits that in many
scheduling algorithms definitive decisions on these two questions can be
made when packets are enqueued. The resultant design uses a single
abstraction: the push-in first-out queue (PIFO), a priority queue that
maintains the scheduling order or time.

The paper discusses how to leverage configurable per-packet processing and
the ability to maintain mutable state inside switches to achieve fair
bandwidth allocation across all traversing flows. The problem is that
implementing fair queuing mechanisms in high-speed switches is expensive,
since they require complex flow classification, buffer allocation, and
scheduling on a per-packet basis. The proposed dequeuing scheduler, called
Rotating Strict Priority scheduler, simulates an ideal round-robin scheme
where each active flow transmits a single bit of data in every round, which
allows to transmit packets from multiple queues in approximate sorted
order.

the parallelism available on modern GPUs, while remaining flexible, with
packet processing tasks implemented as simple modular elements that are
composed to build fully functional routers and switches. Snap is based on
the Click modular router, which it extends by adding new architectural
features that support batched packet processing, memory structures
optimized for offloading to coprocessors, and asynchronous scheduling with
in-order completion.

The paper introduces ClickOS, a high-performance, virtualized software
middlebox platform. ClickOS virtual machines are small (5MB), boot quickly
(about 30 milliseconds), add little delay (45 microseconds), and over one
hundred of them can be concurrently run while saturating a 10Gb pipe on a
commodity server. A wide range of middleboxes is implemented, including a
firewall, a carrier-grade NAT and a load balancer, and the evaluations
suggest that ClickOS can handle packets in the millions per second.

BESS is the Berkeley Extensible Software Switch developed at the University
of California, Berkeley and at Nefeli Networks. BESS is heavily inspired by
the Click modular router, representing a packet processing pipeline as a
dataflow (multi)graph that consists of modules, each of which implements a
NIC feature, and ports that act as sources and sinks for this
pipeline. Packets received at a port flow through the pipeline to another
port, and each module in the pipeline performs module-specific operations
on packets.

The authors argue that, instead of enforcing the same universal fast-path
semantics to all OpenFlow applications and optimizing for the common case,
as it is done in Open vSwitch, a programmable software switch should rather
automatically specialize its dataplane piecemeal with respect to the
configured workload. Tyey introduce ESwitch, a switch architecture that
uses on-the-fly template-based code generation to compile any OpenFlow
pipeline into efficient machine code, which can then be readily used as the
switch fast-path, delivering superior packet processing speed, improved
latency and CPU scalability, and predictable performance.

The paper makes the observation that data-plane compilation is
fundamentally statically, i.e., the input of the compiler is a fixed
description of the forwarding plane semantics and the output is code that
can accommodate any packet processing behavior set by the controller at
runtime. The authors advocate a dynamic approach to data plane compilation
instead, where not just the semantics but the intended behavior is also
also input to the compiler, opening the door to a handful of runtime
optimization opportunities that can be leveraged to improve the performance
of custom-compiled datapaths beyond what is possible in a static setting.

Netmap is a framework that enables commodity operating systems to

inefficiencies in OSes' standard packet processing datapaths: per-packet
dynamic memory allocations are removed by preallocating resources, system
call overheads are amortized over large I/O batches, and memory copies are
eliminated by sharing buffers and metadata between kernel and userspace,
while still protecting access to device registers and other kernel memory

The paper is motivated by the challenges involved in consistent updates of

datapaths and the exposed opaque configuration mechanisms.  The authors
demonstrate that even simple rule updates result in inconsistent packet
switching in multi-table datapaths.  The main contribution of the paper is
a hardware design that supports a transactional configuration mechanism,
providing strong switch-level atomicity: all packets traversing the
datapath will encounter either the old configuration or the new one, and
never an inconsistent mix of the two. The approach is prototyped using the
NetFPGA hardware platform.

A follow-up to the RMT paper. dRMT (disaggregated Reconfigurable
Match-Action Table) is a new architecture for programmable switches, which
overcomes two important restrictions of RMT: (1) table memory is local to
an RMT pipeline stage, implying that memory not used by one stage cannot be
reclaimed by another, and (2) RMT is hardwired to always sequentially
execute matches followed by actions as packets traverse pipeline
stages. dRMT resolves both issues by disaggregating the memory and compute
resources of a programmable switch, moving table memories out of pipeline
stages and into a centralized pool that is accessible through a
crossbar. In addition, dRMT replaces RMT's pipeline stages with a cluster
of processors that can execute match and action operations in any order.

overheads inherent to packer processing applications is the inefficient use
of the memory and I/O resources by commodity network interface cards

used to reduce packet processing overheads; FlexNIC allows services to
install packet processing rules into the NIC, which then executes simple
operations on packets while exchanging them with host memory. This moves
some of the packet processing traditionally done in software to the NIC,

This is the answer to the question raised by the "Raising the Bar for Using
GPUs" paper.  Kalia et al. argue that the key enabler for high
packet-processing performance is the inherent feature of GPU that
automatically hides memory access latency rather than its parallel
computation power and claim that CPU can outperform or achieve a similar
performance as GPU if its code is re-arranged to run concurrently with
memory access. This paper revists these claims and find, with eight popular
algorithms widely used in network applications, that (a) there are many
compute-bound algorithms that do benefit from the parallel computation
capacity of GPU while CPU-based optimizations fail to help, and (b) the
relative performance advantage of CPU over GPU in most applications is due
to data transfer bottleneck in PCIe communication of discrete GPU rather
than lack of capacity of GPU itself.

This paper is motivated by the limitations of existing IP multipath
protocols relying on per-flow static hashing, which can result in
suboptimal throughput and bandwidth losses due to long-term
collisions. Hedera is a dynamic flow scheduling system for multi-stage
switch topologies as they often appear in data centers. Hedera uses flow
information from constituent switches and reroutes traffic to
non-conflicting routes accordingly. The authors show that the more global
view of routing and traffic demands allows Hedera to see bottlenecks that
switch-local schedulers cannot, and to adaptively schedule the switching
fabric in a way which significantly improves aggregate network utilization
with minimal overheads.

The main contribution of this work is providing a set of general building
blocks that mask the limitations of programmable switches (limited state,
support limited types of operations, limited per-packet computation) using
approximation techniques and thereby enabling the implementation of
realistic network protocols. These building blocks are then used to tackle
the network resource allocation problem within datacenters and realize
approximate variants of congestion control and load balancing protocols,
such as XCP, RCP, and CONGA, that require explicit support from the
network. The evaluations show that the proposed approximations are accurate
and that they do not exceed the hardware resource limits associated with
flexible switches.

A keynote from Nick McKeown at NetPL'17 on the many great research ideas
and new languages that have emerged for programmable forwarding. The talk
considers how we got here, why programmable forwarding planes are
inevitable, why now is the right time, why they are a final frontier for
SDN, and why they are here to stay.

A seminal paper for deploying SDN in enterprise networks, this paper
presents Ethane, a network architecture allowing managers to define a
single network-wide fine-grain policy and then enforcing it
directly. Ethane couples extremely simple flow-based Ethernet switches with
a centralized controller that manages the admittance and routing of
flows. While radical, this design is backwards-compatible with existing
hosts and switches.  Ethane was implemented in both hardware and software,
supporting both wired and wireless hosts.

SoftCell aims to overcome today's expensive, inflexible and complex
cellular core networks by supporting fine-grained policies for mobile
devices, using commodity switches and servers.  In particular, SoftCell
allows to flexibly route traffic through sequences of middleboxes based on
subscriber attributes and applications.  Scalability is achieved by
minimizing the size of the forwarding tables, using aggregation, and by
performing packet classification at the access switches, next to the base
stations.

The paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of B4, a
private WAN connecting Google's data centers across the planet. B4 has a
number of unique characteristics: (1) massive bandwidth requirements
deployed to a modest number of sites, (2) elastic traffic demand that seeks
to maximize average bandwidth, and (3) full control over the edge servers
and network, which enables rate limiting and demand measurement at the
edge. These characteristics led to a Software Defined Networking architecture
using OpenFlow to control relatively simple switches built from merchant
silicon.

To support deploying SDNs into the Evolved Packet Core (EPC), the paper
presents the design and evaluation of a system architecture for a software
EPC that achieves high and scalable performance. The authors postulate that
the poor scaling of existing EPC systems stems from the manner in which the
system is decomposed, which leads to device state being duplicated across
multiple components, which in turn results in frequent interactions between
the different components. An alternate approach is proposed in which state
for a single device is consolidated in one location and EPC functions are
reorganized for efficient access to this consolidated state. A prototype
for PEPC is also presented, as a software EPC that implements the key
components of the design.

This paper presents the packet classifier algorithm that underlies the Open
vSwitch fast-path. Packet classification requires matching each packet
against a database of flow rules and forwarding the packet according to the
highest priority rule. The paper introduces a generic packet classification
algorithm, called Tuple Space Search (TSS), based on the observation that
real databases typically use only a small number of distinct field lengths.
Thus, by mapping rules to tuples even a simple linear search of the tuple
space can provide significant speedup over naive linear search over the
filters. Each tuple is maintained as a hash table that can be searched in
one memory access.

Content-addressable memory (CAM) and Ternary CAM (TCAM) chips are the most
important component in programmable switch ASICs, performing packet
classification according to configurable header fields, matching rules, and
priority, in a single clock cycle using dedicated comparison circuitry. The
paper surveys recent developments in the design of large-capacity CAMs. The
main CAM-design challenge is to reduce power consumption associated with
the large amount of parallel active circuitry, without sacrificing speed or
memory density. The paper reviews CAM-design techniques at the circuit
level and at the architectural level.

Programmable routers often need to support a separate forwarding
information base (FIB) for each virtual router provisioned by the
controller, which leads to memory scaling challenges. In this paper, a
small, shared FIB data structure is presented and a fast lookup algorithm
that capitalize on the commonality of IP prefixes between each
FIB. Experiments with real packet traces and routing tables show that the
approach achieves much lower memory requirements and considerably faster
lookup times.

Ternary Content-Addressable Memories (TCAMs) have become the industrial
standard for high-throughput packet classification, and as such, for
programmable switch ASICs. However, one major drawback of TCAMs is their
high power consumption. In this paper, a practical and efficient solution
is proposed which introduces a smart pre-classifier to reduce power
consumption of TCAMs for multi-dimensional packet classification. The
classifier dimension is reduced by pre-classifying a packet on two header
fields, source and destination IP addresses. Then, the high dimensional
problem can use only a small portion of a TCAM for a given packet. The
pre-classifier is built such that a given packet matches at most one entry
in the pre-classifier, and each rule is stored only once in one of the TCAM
blocks, which avoids rule replication. The presented solution uses
commodity TCAMs.

Programmable switches usually need to implement some or more match-action
tables in the fast-path.  This paper presents CuckooSwitch, a
software-based switch design built around a memory-efficient,
high-performance, and highly-concurrent hash table for compact and fast FIB
lookup. The authors show that CuckooSwitch can process the maximum packets
per second rate achievable across the underlying hardware's PCI buses while
maintaining a forwarding table of one billion forwarding entries.

The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate how data compression can
benefit the networking community, by showing how to squeeze the
longest-prefix-matching lookup table, consulted by switches for IP lookup,
into information-theoretical entropy bounds with essentially zero cost on
lookup performance and FIB update. The state-of-the-art in compressed data
structures yields a static entropy-compressed FIB representation with
asymptotically optimal lookup. Since this data structure results too slow
for practical uses, the authors redesign the venerable prefix tree to also
admit entropy bounds and support lookup in optimal time and update in
nearly optimal time.

Efficient packet classification is a core concern for programmable network
devices, but it is also very difficult to implement
efficiently. Traditional multi-field classification approaches, in both
software and ternary content-addressable memory (TCAMs), entail trade-offs
between (memory) space and (lookup) time. In this work, a novel approach is
presented, which identifies properties of many classifiers that can be
implemented in linear space and with worst-case guaranteed logarithmic time
and allows the addition of more fields including range constraints without
impacting space and time complexities.

The authors argue that a hybrid software-hardware switch may help in
lowering the flow-table entries installation time, and present ShadowSwitch
(sSw), an OpenFlow switch prototype that implements such a design. sSw
builds on two key observations. First, software tables are very fast to be
updated, hence, forwarding tables updates always happen in software first
and, eventually, entries are moved to the TCAM to achieve higher overall
throughput and offload the software forwarder. Lookup in software is
performed only in case there are no entries matching a packet in
hardware. Second, since deleting entries from TCAM is much faster than
adding them, ShadowSwitch may translate an entry installation in a mix of
installation in software tables and deletion from hardware tables.

The paper presents the design and evaluation of Hermes, a practical and

for control plane actions, in particular, inserting, modifying, or deleting

TCAM space for assured performance.
